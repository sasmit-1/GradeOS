# GradeOS
SRM Grade Tracker is a visually stunning, high-performance web application designed to replace the clunky official student portals. Built with a "Deep Space" aesthetic, it allows students to track their academic performance, calculate SGPAs in real-time, and simulate future grades with a built-in target calculator.
